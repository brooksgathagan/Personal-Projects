# Morse Code Translator

A simple application to translate Morse Code -- from text to morse code, and from morse code to text. Invalid characters are given either an "!" or "?".

# Jordan Kombat

This was a practice project that I did to practice OOP fundamentals & basic C#.  I cringe looking back at some things, but it was a lot of fun overall.  It was also my first exposure to the "Ah, but I could add this feature, too!" rabbit hole that leads to an acceptance of incompletion.  

The console app has three base stages (two levels per stage), including a pair of bonus rounds that are accessible upon completing the "final boss" stage. Michael Jordan is the user-controlled hero of the game, who gains abilities at each stage passed.  It's a silly game (Bob Ross and Joe Rogan are the "commentators" of each match) that no one in their right mind would play, but it was fun.  Might try to create a 2D fighter out of it w/ Unity...someday!

# Tower Defense

This was my first "project" in C#.  Coding alongside an online course from Team Treehouse, I created a "Tower Defense" game, whereby "invaders" are targeted & fired upon by various towers.  If the invaders reach a certain point on our "map," the game is lost; if all invaders are destroyed, the game is won.  While this was a code-along project, I added some additional classes & functionality.
